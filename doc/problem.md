# Problem statement
A customer has asked you for a way to provide on-demand monitoring of various
servers without having to log into each individual machine and opening up the log
files found in a given directory. Choose a platform on which you would like to
develop (Windows, Linux, or Mac) and a starting directory (perhaps /var/log on Linux
and Mac platforms or C:\ProgramData on Windows platforms). The customer has
asked for the ability to issue a REST request to a machine in order to retrieve logs
from the starting directory on the machine receiving the REST request.

# Acceptance criteria
1. A README file describing how to run and use the service.
2. An HTTP REST API exposing at least one endpoint that can return the lines
requested from a given log file.
3. The lines returned must be presented with the newest log events first. It is safe
to assume that log files will be written with newest events at the end of the
file.
4. The REST API should support additional query parameters which include
 * The ability to specify a filename within the starting directory
 * The ability to filter results based on basic text/keyword matches
 * The ability to specify the last n number of matching entries to retrieve
within the log
5. The service should work and be reasonable performant when requesting files
of >1GB
6. Minimize the number of external dependencies in the business logic code
path. For example, if implementing your project with Node.js:
 * Feel free to use Express or similar as the HTTP server as well as any of
the built-in Node.js modules like fs.
 * Please do not use external libraries for any file reads or working with
the log lines after you’ve read them. We want to see your solution in
this case using only what Node.js has built-in.

# Bonus points
If you finish the project early and want to add a little bit of polish, feel free to
implement a basic UI to interact with the API. This can make it a bit easier for you to
demo your project to us when the time comes, but isn’t required for a complete
submission (we’re just as happy using curl/Postman/etc. to interact with the API).

# Only if you really want to
If you finish the assignment early and want to challenge yourself with a bit more,
there’s one additional feature you could add. Working on this part in no way affects
the scoring of the project, but if you decide you want to do it anyway, it may lead to
some interesting discussions during the next interview phase. Add the ability to issue
a REST request to one “primary” server which subsequently requests those logs from
a list of “secondary” servers. There aren’t any hard requirements for the protocol
used between the primary and secondary servers, and the architecture is completely
up to you.
